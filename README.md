data analysis with pandas  

## Intro
for this project I wanted to practice data analysis, and how to manipulate and display information regarding it.  
this is a useful thing to practice if I was going into data analysis as a carreer.  
Ultimatly I enjoyed my time practicing these principles.  
  
In this program I downloaded five csv files.  
These files had survey answers to the question who is the happiest country.  
With these files I was able to answer two questions.

question 1: how does America's perception of the gdp effect the overall happiness of the nation?

question 2. what is the most happy reigon of the world to live in.

I will discuss and post pictures of the answers later but first, 

## how to set up pandas, numpy and matplot lib

this program was written in python using a couple libraries.  
  
to download pandas and all of the other programs, you first need to have python installed.  
after that it is as simple as opening up your command prompt and download the libraries through pip.  
  
for example you could download all the libraries you need by typing  

pip install pandas  
pip install numpy  
pip install matplotlib  
  
one at a time in the command prompt  
after you download all of the libraries you can import them to your python file and start working.  
  
pandas was useful as it brings in an object known as a dataframe,  
which easily could be extracted from a csv file.  
after it is extracted you are then able to manipulate, sort and display the csv files information  
  
numpy is a really useful library becuase it suplies you with a lot of mathimatical functions.  
  
matplotlib is what I used to display the information in useful graphs.  
This makes your datasets more understandable, and helps you answer your questions  

## the program

to run the program correctly you simple need to run the program. after it starts it should show a picture of your first graph.  
after you close it another window with another graph will appear.  
  
so to answer the questions.  

question 1. how does america's perception of the gdp effect the overal happieness of the nation?  
  
![first graph](https://github.com/bshort95/data_an_python/blob/main/Capture1.JPG?raw=true)

this chart shows the happiness scores of america over the last five years,  
along with the perception of the gdp, and how it influences happiness,
  
this graph shows me that in the long run americas perception of the gdp does  
not nessisarily connect with the happiness. maybe it is the other way around,  
and a knowledge of our gdp encourages us to be more happy.  
ultimalty there was a fall of happyness in 2016 but a rise in the perception of the  
gdp. which leads me to believe if there is any corolation it is minimal.



question 2. what is the most happy reigon of the world to live in?  

![second graph](https://github.com/bshort95/data_an_python/blob/main/Capture2.JPG?raw=true)

this graph shows that the happiest places to live are in western europe. it makes sense as it is  
really beutiful. and in some of the smaller countries there are living benifits that come with a smaller  
government. but i still have hope becuase north america is in a close second.
  
  
I found the data sets on kaggle.com. and here is the link to the webpage.
